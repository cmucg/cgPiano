## Computer key-board piano, simplified memorizing: one-finger plays one-number-name's low middle high notes
### cgPiano027.zip is the newest
- This soft piano (CG piano) is designed and programmed by Dr.ChenGuang, under the MIT License.
- It is very easy to memorize the keys, because one finger plays low mid high notes of the same number:
- left-little-finger controls keys Z, A, Q for low 1, mid 1, high 1
- left-ring-finger controls keys X, S, W for low 2, mid 2, high 2
- left-mid-finger controls keys C, D, E for low 3, mid 3, high 3
- left-index-finger controls keys V, F, R for low 4, mid 4, high 4

- right-index-finger controls keys M, J, U for low 5, mid 5, high 5
- ... ...
- Same as and easier than Standard English Typing Technique.

- You can choose to make the sound continue after releasing a key until you play another note or press the space-bar.
- You can also choose to make the sound stop as soon as you release a key.

## From cgKeyBoardPiano026.html on:
- Change-pitch function is added: click in the input-box and rotate mouse wheel to set how-many semitones. 
- When a key is pressed, if it has note, its note will play for a long time, until the next key is pressed to play another note or space-bar pressed to stop. 
- It also needs Tone.js, just like cgKeyBoardPiano025

## From cgPiano027 on:
- Shift+key plays 1 semitone higher. Just like the black keys in piano. 
- Change pitch: rotate mouse-wheel or left right up down arrow-keys. 
- Change pitch is displayed as both n semitones and letters.

## from cgPiano028 on:
- Allows pressing 2 or 3 keys at the same time. Of course, pressing one by one is also OK.
